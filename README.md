1.To save your face in the device you need to run the code1.py file that in first place will ask your name and then the camera will take 30 pictures of you within 2-5 seconds and will then save those 30 images in a folder named by the name you entered earlier.

2.To train the machine you need to run the code2.py file that will train the machine with the 30 pictures (Machine Learning) that it took of you and then it will never fail when you come in front of the camera .

3.Now the final file code3.py you need to run this once only. 

4.Now if a person whose face is saved in the device comes in front of the camera , the machine recognizes it and sends a signal to rpi then to relay that is attached and the door unlocks ,at the same time the rpi sends a signal to the argon particle via cloud and the particle sends an email via IFTTT to the house owner.
